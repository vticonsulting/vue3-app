        Roof - Hail
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Hail damage to a composition shingle roof system consists of bruising or
        fracturing of the shingle mat. Bruising is most common at unsupported locations
        and usually requires manual examination to confirm that damage has occurred to the
        shingle mat. Fracturing typically occurs at unsupported locations and is readily
        evident. These conditions can promote the absorption of moisture and subsequent
        deterioration of a shingle. Hail damage to a roof is quantified by the analysis of
        "test squares" (10' x 10' Area). The purpose of the test squares is to determine
        the amount of hail damage in a representative area of the roof. The test square
        results are then applied to individual roof fields, or the roof as a whole, to
        estimate the total damage incurred. Protocol calls for the examination of four (4)
        test squares â€“ One (1) facing each direction. Larger and/or more complex roofs
        typically require additional test squares at the discretion of the adjuster.
        Additionally, a cursory overview of the remainder of each field is conducted to
        confirm the findings of the test squares.

        Roof - Wind

      <p class="mt-2">
        Wind damage to an asphalt composition shingle consists of; creasing, tearing,
        complete detachment, and impacts from wind driven objects. Wind damage totals are
        acquired on a shingle damaged per slope basis. If wind damage is present a
        brittleness "repairability" test is performed on each slope that sustained damage.
        A brittleness test is performed by detaching a shingle at the tar strip and
        lifting approximately three inches or a 40-degree angle. This would be the
        necessary shingle manipulation required to feather and replace a damaged shingle.

      <p class="mt-2">
        Metal roof accessory items rarely suffer functional damage from hail impact.
        However, hail may cause aesthetic damage in the form of indentations. Rooftop
        penetrations can offer clear and permanent indications of hailstone impacts,
        including hail size and direction of the hail fall. Light gauge metal items will
        often suffer indentations even when the roofing material escapes damage.
